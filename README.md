This is a repository for a personal website of Vaughn Casarez.
This website is a big project and is currently a work in progress. So far only Bioworld is the only brand with a page and only one of their backpacks have an indiviual page.
This is a personal passion project where I want to catalog every piece of FNaF merchandise made and I hope to complete my goal as I work on this in my limited freetime.
